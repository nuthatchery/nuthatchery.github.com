  <h1>About Nuthatch</h1>
  <p>
	Nuthatch is a software transformation based on the idea of tree
	walking, where transformations are described as walks that proceed in
	programmer-defined steps which may observe join points of a traversal,
	may affect state associated with the walk, may rewrite the walked tree,
	and must walk somewhere.
