<h3>Walk Your Tree Any Way You Want</h3>
<h5>Anya Helene Bagge and Ralf LÃ¤mmel</h5>
<p>
<em>Abstract.</em> We describe a new approach to software transformation,
which is inspired by strategic and adaptive programming, though without
starting from the same kind of separation between traversal specification
and actions to be applied along traversal. Instead, transformations are
described as walks that proceed in programmer-defined steps which may
observe join points of a traversal, may affect state associated with the walk,
may rewrite the walked tree, and must walk somewhere. The approach
blends well with OO programming. We have implemented the approach
in the Nuthatch/J library for Java.
