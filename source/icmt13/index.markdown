This page collects examples and extra resources for the ICMT (International
Conference on Model Transformation) paper *[Walk Your Tree Any Way You
Want](http://softlang.uni-koblenz.de/nuthatch/)*. 


*Note: we may continue update and improve this page up until the time of
 the conference (June 18–19, 2013). After that, this page will be locked
 and the source code tagged, so that the resources remain consistent with
 the paper even though Nuthatch is developed further.*
