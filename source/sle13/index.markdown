*Abstract.* Proper formatting makes the structure of a program apparent and
aids program comprehension. The need to format code arises in code
generation and transformation, as well as in normal reading and editing
situations. Commonly used pretty-printing tools in transformation
frameworks provide an easy way to produce indented code that is fairly
readable for humans, without reaching the level of purpose-built
reformatting tools, such as those built into IDEs. This paper presents a
library of pluggable components, built to support style-based formatting
and reformatting of code, and to enable further experimentation with code
formatting.
